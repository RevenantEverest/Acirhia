  'Please excuse me, traveler. Your help would be much apprecited.

  Everything is collapsing on us, or at least it will if we don''t something about it right now! But I only have 2 hands, I can''t do everything by myself. We need more power to stabilize the engines, more oil to grease the cogs and, well, I could use a drink right about now. Fetch me what I need so I can prevent this place from crumbling down upon us.

  I wish I could pay you far more than I can, but what I can pay isn''t less than what''s fair either.',

  'You there, traveler. Your assistance is required.

  We''re on the offensive at last, but the battle has not been won just yet. To win we will have to go all out and we can use every fighter we can get. Hero, join us and help us kill those vicious gnomes. I''ll join you, if you''ll have me. It''ll be my pleasure.
  Be careful hero, don''t underestimate those gnomes. Try to take down as many of them as possible, the less of a threat they pose the better.

  There''s no big reward at the end of the line, but I think my reward will be more than fair. I hope you return swiftly hero, we believe in you.',
